<h3> Your Friendly Local AI Companion </h3>

</div>

**Ollie** (formerly OllamaGUI) is a personal AI assistant you run on your own Linux machine. It provides a polished, modern interface for chatting with local LLMs via Ollama—no CLI required.

If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels premium, fast, and always-on, this is it.

## Install (Linux AppImage)

No configuration needed. Just download and run.

```bash
# Download the AppImage (v0.2.4)
wget https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie/releases/download/v0.2.4/Ollie_0.2.4_amd64.AppImage

# Make it executable
chmod +x Ollie_0.2.4_amd64.AppImage

# Run it
./Ollie_0.2.4_amd64.AppImage
```

*Requirements: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running.*

## Highlights

**Local-First Experience**
Ollie runs entirely on your machine. Your chats, data, and models stay private. No cloud dependencies, no tracking.

**Modern Chat Interface**
A clean, distraction-free UI built with React and Tailwind. Supports full Markdown rendering, code highlighting, tables, and math equations.

**Model Management**
Pull, delete, and manage your Ollama models directly from the app. No need to drop to the terminal.

**Vision & File Analysis**
Drag and drop images to analyze them with vision models like LLaVA. Upload PDFs and text files to chat with your documents instantly.

**Monitoring Dashboard**
Real-time tracking of system resources (CPU, Memory), running models with VRAM usage, and the ability to stop/unload models directly from the dashboard.

**Dark Theme**
Full dark mode with a light/dark/system toggle. System mode follows your OS preference automatically.
