## What the App Is

Desktop AI chat client bridging local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) LLMs.

**Core concerns:**
- Conversation persistence (SQLite, user data must survive upgrades)
- Streaming rendering (smooth, cancellable, resilient)
- Tool execution via MCP (bounded, observable, recoverable)
- System monitoring (Ollama health, model VRAM, system metrics)

**Statefulness is the hard problem.** LLM conversations accumulate history, hit context limits, switch providers mid-session, and run tool loops. Every architectural decision must account for this.

---

## Critical Issues (fix first)

### C1 — `chatStore.ts` is a God Object ✅ DONE

Extracted 974-line god object into focused services:

```
app/src/services/persistenceService.ts  — all DB invoke() wrappers
app/src/services/conversationService.ts — provider resolution, context budget, API messages
app/src/services/streamingPipeline.ts   — drip queue, 6 event listeners, render throttle
app/src/store/chatStore.ts              — thin Zustand slice (~280 lines, pure state)
```

`sendMessage` and `editUserMessage` share the same streaming pipeline — no duplication.

---

### C2 — No conversation context window management

The app sends **the entire conversation history** to the LLM on every message. For a 50-message conversation with 3 attached files, this can be hundreds of thousands of tokens — hitting provider limits and causing silent API failures.

There is no truncation strategy. Long conversations fail at the API level with a generic error string.

**Required strategies:**
- Sliding window: keep last N turns
- Budget guard: estimate token count before sending, truncate oldest turns
- Summary injection (future): compress old turns into a system message

**Files to touch:** `conversationService.ts` (new), `app/src/store/chatStore.ts`.

---

### C3 — No DB migration framework

Schema changes are done with inline SQL and a bare `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` that silently swallows errors:

```rust
let _ = sqlx::query("ALTER TABLE chats ADD COLUMN title TEXT").execute(&pool).await;
```

When a future version changes the schema non-additively (rename column, restructure `meta_json`, add constraint), there is no migration path. User data can be silently broken on upgrade.

`sqlx::migrate!()` is already in the dependency tree — it is not used.

**Fix:**
1. Create `src-tauri/migrations/` directory with numbered `.sql` files
2. Replace inline `CREATE TABLE` with `sqlx::migrate!("../migrations").run(&pool).await?`
3. Move all schema to migration files

**Files to touch:** `src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs`, new `src-tauri/migrations/` files.

---

## High Priority Issues

### H1 — API keys stored plaintext

`~/.config/ollie/settings.json` contains all provider API keys in plaintext. Any process running as the user can read them.

**Fix:** Store keys in OS keychain (libsecret on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows). Reference by a non-sensitive ID in settings.json. Tauri has `tauri-plugin-stronghold` for encrypted local storage as an alternative.

**Files to touch:** `src-tauri/src/commands/settings.rs`, `app/src/store/settingsStore.ts`.

---

### H2 — Global `lazy_static` state instead of Tauri managed state ✅ DONE

Replaced all three globals with Tauri managed state structs registered in `setup()`:

```rust
// lib.rs
app.manage(AppStreams::default());      // replaces ACTIVE_STREAMS
app.manage(MonitoringState::default()); // replaces MONITORING_ACTIVE
app.manage(McpClients::default());      // replaces ACTIVE_MCP_CLIENTS
```

Commands receive state via `State<T>` injection. MCP commands fully rewritten to use `State<McpClients>`. `ChatOrchestrator` takes `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<McpClient>>>>` directly.

---

### H3 — No provider capability abstraction

Vision support detected by string-matching model names in `openai.rs`:
```rust
model.contains("vision") || model.contains("gpt-4o") || model.contains("gpt-4-turbo")
```

Tool support assumed for all providers. Breaks silently when:
- New models release that don't match patterns
- User configures a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- Provider adds/removes capabilities

**Fix:** Add `capabilities()` to the `LLMProvider` trait:
```rust
fn capabilities(&self, model: &str) -> ProviderCapabilities
```
```rust
pub struct ProviderCapabilities {
    pub vision: bool,
    pub tools: bool,
    pub streaming: bool,
    pub max_context_tokens: usize,
}
```

UI decisions (show image button, enable tools, context budget) driven by capability queries.

**Files to touch:** `src-tauri/src/providers/traits.rs`, all provider implementations.

---

### H4 — Dual settings persistence (two sources of truth) ✅ DONE

Removed Zustand `persist` middleware from `settingsStore`. Backend is now the single source of truth. `loadSettingsFromBackend()` called on mount; all writes go to backend only. No localStorage involvement.

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### M1 — HTTP clients not pooled

Every command creates a new `reqwest::Client`:
```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder().timeout(...).build().unwrap_or_default();
```

`reqwest::Client` holds a connection pool, TLS session cache, and HTTP/2 multiplexer. Creating one per command discards all of this. Under simultaneous load (monitoring + streaming + model pull), 3 independent pools open to the same host.

**Fix:** Single `reqwest::Client` as Tauri managed state, injected via `State<HttpClient>`.

**Files to touch:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, all commands that build a client.

---

### M2 — Errors are untyped strings

All Rust commands return `Result<T, String>`. Frontend receives an opaque string and can only display it. Cannot distinguish:
- Network error → retry
- Auth error → open settings
- Model not found → open model picker
- Rate limit → backoff + inform user
- Context too long → truncate + retry

**Fix:** Typed error enum serialized to JSON with a `type` discriminator field. Frontend pattern-matches on type for intelligent recovery.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
#[serde(tag = "type")]
pub enum OllieError {
    Network { message: String },
    Auth { message: String, provider: String },
    ModelNotFound { model: String },
    ContextTooLong { tokens: usize, limit: usize },
    // ...
}
```

**Files to touch:** New `src-tauri/src/error.rs`, all command return types.

---

### M3 — MCP servers have no reconnection or health check

MCP servers are subprocess connections or SSE streams. Either can die. The app has no reconnection mechanism — tool calls silently fail. The "connected" badge never goes to "disconnected" once set.

**Fix:**
- Heartbeat ping on MCP connections (30s interval)
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff on failure
- Frontend status driven by live health checks, not connection-time snapshot

**Files to touch:** `src-tauri/src/mcp/mod.rs`, `src-tauri/src/mcp/transport.rs`.

---

### M4 — No content size limits at attachment boundaries

Files read fully into memory via `FileReader.readAsText()` and stored in `meta_json`. A 50MB log file will:
1. OOM the renderer process
2. Get stored fully in SQLite
3. Get sent to the LLM API every turn (API rejects it)

Tool result truncation exists at 8000 chars in orchestrator. File attachments have nothing.

**Fix:** Enforce limits at the attachment point:
- 500KB per file hard limit (show error if exceeded)
- 2MB total per message
- Truncation warning in UI

**Files to touch:** `app/src/components/MainPanel.tsx`.

---

## Low Priority / Future

### L1 — No pagination in chat list

`db_list_chats_with_preview` loads up to 200 chats. Will scale poorly at 1000+ chats. Needs cursor-based pagination.

### L2 — Auto-title uses full streaming infrastructure

The auto-title LLM call uses the same streaming pipeline as chat. It should use a simple one-shot completion, not a streaming call with event listeners.

### L3 — No MCP tool validation

Tool `input_schema` is raw JSON passed through without validation. Invalid arguments sent to tools crash silently.

### L4 — No connection pooling for SQLite writes

All DB writes go through a 5-connection pool. Heavy concurrent writes (monitoring + chat) can queue. WAL mode helps but doesn't eliminate this.

### L5 — MCP client info hardcoded to v0.2.1

`src-tauri/src/mcp/mod.rs` sends `"version": "0.2.1"` in the MCP initialize handshake regardless of actual app version. Should read from `Cargo.toml` at compile time via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.
